<h2>About the Artist</h2>
<p>
    Genario is an artist and musician from Chicago, IL. Both his music and visual art is uniquely him. He focuses on the surreal, blending the lines between fantasy and reality. He evokes a sense of mystique wonder and confusion. As a jack of all trade he explores 3D art, video production, and all types of visual art. He has dabbled in oil painting (although I am trying to get him to try acrylic paint) and sculpting. His main form of expression is his music, but this is a page dedicated to some of his digital art.
